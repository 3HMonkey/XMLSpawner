Welcome to the UNOFFICIAL releases of XMLSpawner for newer versions of RunUO 2.1 and up.

I myself take NO credit in fixing these, just finding and posting maintaining workable versions that compile.

RunUO 2.1 fix by shrundowr source:

Runuo 2.2 fix by Orbsydia

SVN versions not entirely supported!

NOTE:
By running the 2.1 verion on a production server, it failed as they had switched the spawning interface so if 2.1 doesn't compile on your 2.1 server, please try 2.2, if it does compile then leave it and enjoy!
